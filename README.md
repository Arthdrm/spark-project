# Project Description
This project was built for Big Data course final. The purpose of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model with a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm 
that could predict youtube comments' sentiment (Negative/Positive) regarding iPhone 15 products. The model itself was trained on iPhone 14 Pro datasets (also coming from youtube comments) that were labeled
using a pre-trained hugging-face model (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest). Youtube comments were collected using Youtube Data API.
